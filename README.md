In this project, I will try to create a chess engine using traditional, non ML methods. My primary resource is the [chess programming website](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Getting_Started). In the first part of the project, I create the frontend using HTML/CSS and scripting in JS.

# To Do:
Backend:
- Establish connection between frontend and backend


Frontend:
- Queening choice
- Material Count 
- Moves table scroll
- Return to board button after end of game
- Fine-tune the arithmetic notation: 
    - for when multiple pieces can land on the same square
    - unicode symbols for the pieces?
- Fix interactivity (dragging a piece should drag its image, show legal moves correctly without needing even clicks)
- Undo move
- Add different colours for selected light and dark squares?
- Check code for redundancies (unncessary execution of functions, etc.)
